The objective of the exercise is to mimic real work conditions, which includes code, iterations, research and communication. ðŸ˜€

At any moment, questions are welcomed!

At some point, you'll need to suggest a solution to your assigned challenges. 
To do so, fork this repository and make a pull request **in your own fork**
with your implementation. You can make one pull request per challenge.

We'll use this pull request to iterate, review and discuss your implementation.

When submitting the pull request, you need to answer few questions. These questions are listed in the [pull request template](https://github.com/getstation/tapas/tree/master/.github/pull_request_template.md).
