Summary:

Here, make a summary of what challenges, or
what parts of challenges, you were able to
complete, or not.

Give an estimation of time spent on each.
 -->

## Test instructions and expectations
<!--
Provide the reviewer with instructions to
test your implementation and with what to
expect when testing.
 -->

## How does it work?
<!--
Explain the key elements of your solutions.
Link to documentations if necessary.
-->

### Alternatives
<!--
If any, list alternative solutions, valid
or not, and explain your choice.

If you tried other solutions that did
not work, it's a good opportunity to mention
them.
-->

## Critical analysis

### General feeling
<!--
What have you thought about these challenges?

Do you think your implementation reflects
correctly your technical skills?

(we'll have the opportunity to discuss these
points orally, if necessary)
-->

### Difficulties
<!--
If any, list the difficulties you faced
when trying to complete the challenges and
how you overcome them.

(you very probably faced difficulties)
-->

### Strengths and weaknesses
<!--
List and argue the points of strengths
or weaknesses of your implementation.

For weaknesses, suggest improvements
and give an estimation of the time
necessary to implement them.

You can use line comments to point
to certain parts in your code.
