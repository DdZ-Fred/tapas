# React drag'n'drop list
The objective of this challenge is to create a list of people using React.

## Challenge
- Use the image contained in this repository as your visual guide
- You must consume this endpoint (http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to get the users for the list. How you consume the endpoint is up to you.
- All CSS must be created using reactJSS
- You should be able to drag and drop elements of your list. To ease this part, you must use [React DND](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/)
- Add a "loading" indicator for when the users are being fetched
- This challenge is using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), try to follow this philosophy whenev`er possible
- Drag and drop interactions should be animated. The look and feel of the animations are up to you
